          <p class="blog-post-meta">February 26, 2023 by <a href="#">Lakshmi Narayana</a></p>
  
          <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
          <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
          <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Example lists</h3>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First list item</li>
            <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
            <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First list item</li>
            <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
            <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
          
          
          <h2>Heading</h2>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
          <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
          <pre><code>Example code block</code></pre>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout.</p>
